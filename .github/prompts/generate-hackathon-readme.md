## Analysis Instructions

Before generating the README:
1. Scan all files in the repository
2. Identify the main technology stack
3. Understand the project structure
4. Find any existing documentation
5. Identify key features from the code
6. Look for configuration files to understand setup requirements

Generate a complete, professional README.md that will impress hackathon judges and make the project easy to understand and evaluate.
